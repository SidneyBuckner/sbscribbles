# Hello, my name is Sidney, and I am a Developer.
*I design and build website experiences that make people's lives simple.*

#### Introduction:

Welcome to my blog. This is a space for my love for tech, food travel and a few miscellaneous misadventures
of my 24 years around the sun. I created this space initially as a small passion project to learn code, and maybe someday, teach it.

However, not only am I a developer, I am also a high school color guard coach. I like to eat crazy foods for brunch. I have a Creative Writing Degree and make short stories aaaaallll the time.
I make small craft projects in the summer, and plan in hopes of traveling more extensively in my lifetime.

So, what do these things all have in common?

Well, at anytime you see my writing; either code by hand or choreography for my students, throughout the pages of all my notebooks, you see scribbles. Swirls, starts, tick marks and other things that DO NOT make sense to another human being. That, and the initials SB stand for my name.

If you like what you see and want to know more, lets unravel the scribbles and see what we find.
