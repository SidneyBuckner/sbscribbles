#### Introduction:

Welcome to my blog. This is a space for my love for tech, food, travel, and a few miscellaneous misadventures
during my 24 years around the sun. I created this space initially as a small passion project to learn code, and maybe someday, teach it.

After college I stood at a crossroads, looking for that perfect career which I would use my brain to solve complex problems, and to make something creative with my own two hands. Now, of course the doubts and research and college burnout lead me to believe that in a way, I would never find that perfect path for me.

Technically everyone, including my instincts, was right.

So where would I go from there? I needed a job! I needed a job that would respect my opinions and ideas, and for something other than memorizing concepts and keeping up with dauntless tasks! Thats when I decided to try Web Development.

Web Development has been the hardest, and most spectacular path to be for that goal. My journey in WebDev began with self paced courses like FreeCodeCamp and Skillcrush.
Every though I made progress I wanted, and needed a  deeper understanding of the content and its purpose.
Through networking and lots of research, I first enrolled in LaunchCode where I studied in a one-day-a-week class session for free! Eventually I enrolled in SavvyCoders, a bootcamp to supplement to my studies. As a current student, I was given the opportunity to strengthen my knowledge and execution of HTML, CSS, jQuery and especially JavaScript.

I have been on this journey for almost two years and it still feels like I have not scratched the surface of learning. In the end, that's the name of the game. Be humble and keep learning!

However, not only am I a developer, I am also a high school color guard coach. I like to eat crazy foods for brunch. I have a Creative Writing Degree and make short stories aaaaallll the time.
I make small craft projects in the summer, and plan in hopes of traveling more extensively in my lifetime.

So, what do these things all have in common?

Well, at anytime you see my writing; either code by hand or choreography for my students, throughout the pages of all my notebooks, you see scribbles. Swirls, stars, tick marks, squiggles and other things that DO NOT make sense to another human being (sometimes not even me). That, and the initials SB stand for my name.

If you like what you see and want to know more, lets unravel the scribbles and see what we find.
